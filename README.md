# Golden Gate Hardware

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Google Cloud

This project is deployed on Google Cloud Run.

To deploy, run the following command:

```bash
gcloud run deploy goldengatehardware --source . --region us-central1 --platform managed
```

This will deploy the latest version of the code to the `goldengatehardware` service.
